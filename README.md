# Mini Shell Project by Lapique Philippe

This project was developed as part of the Holberton School C curriculum for the end of the trimester.  
The goal of this exercise is to create a simple UNIX command-line shell that takes into account environment variables, user input commands, and includes an exit feature through either the `exit` command or the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl+D`.

## üéØ Project Objectives

- Display a prompt and wait for the user to type a command.  
- Each command line must always end with a new line.  
- The prompt must be displayed again after each executed command.  
- If an executable cannot be found, print an error message and display the prompt again.  
- Properly handle errors and the ‚Äúend of file‚Äù condition (`Ctrl+D`).  
- Handle command lines with arguments and the `PATH`.  
- Implement the built-in command `env` to print the current environment.  
- Implement the built-in command `exit` to exit the shell.

## üóÇÔ∏è Project Organization

**Estimated project duration:** 80 hours  
The work was carried out in person on the Bordeaux campus.  

Development was organized using two separate branches:  
- **main**: stored the final project version.  
- **philippe_dev**: development branch used for testing and drafts.  

A dedicated folder called **exercise/** was also included in the repository.  
It contains test files for basic functions before they were assembled into the main shell project.  

Regular check-ins were conducted to review progress and ensure smooth integration.  
At the end of the project, a pull request was used to merge everything into the **main** branch.  

## üß± Project Structure

We decided to split the code into multiple files to better divide the tasks and to isolate functionalities for easier debugging and testing.

- **README.md** : Contains explanations about the project and its structure  
- **.gitignore** : Specifies intentionally untracked files to be ignored by Git  
- **_getenv.c** : Custom implementation of the `_getenv` function to retrieve environment variables  
- **cut.c** : Splits the command line into arguments (tokenization)  
- **execute.c** : Handles execution of commands (direct path or via PATH)  
- **find.c** : Searches for commands in the directories listed in the PATH environment variable  
- **handle.c** : Manages built-in commands such as `exit` and `env`  
- **main.c** : Main loop of the shell, handling user input and process management  
- **main.h** : Header file containing function prototypes and required libraries  
- **Man_shell** : Manual page describing how to use the shell  
- **Author** : File containing information about the project‚Äôs author(s)  

üõ†Ô∏è Compilation :

To compile the project, use the following command.
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o hsh

Example Usage :
